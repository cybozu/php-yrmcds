memcached / yrmcds extension for PHP
====================================

This PHP extension provides an object-oriented interface of [libyrmcds][],
a full-featured [memcached][] / [yrmcds][] client library.

[yrmcds][] is a complete rewrite of memcached that supports replication
and the [server-side locking][locking]. [libyrmcds][] is a companion
client library for yrmcds.

Thanks to yrmcds' server-side locking, this extension can provide a
stable object locking mechanism when combined with [yrmcds][].

Features
--------

* Access to all memcached / yrmcds binary protocol commands.
* Persistent connections.
* Auto prefix keys.
* Transparent LZ4 compression for large objects.
* Asynchronous operations.

As a bonus, a [session handler](yrmcds_session.php) utilizing yrmcds'
server-side locking is also available.

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.4+ or PHP7.
* Linux or MacOS X.
