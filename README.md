memcached / yrmcds extension for PHP
====================================

This PHP extension provides an object-oriented interface of [libyrmcds][],
a full-featured [memcached][] / [yrmcds][] client library.

[yrmcds][] is a complete rewrite of memcached that supports replication
and the [server-side locking][locking]. [libyrmcds][] is a companion
client library for yrmcds.

Thanks to yrmcds' server-side locking, this extension can provide a
stable object locking mechanism when combined with [yrmcds][].
